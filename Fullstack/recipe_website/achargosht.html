            <h2>Preparation</h2>
            <p><em>
                You can make this curry in a pressure cooker for quick cooking alternatively you can also cook in regular pot. Begin with tempering all the seeds in hot oil for a minute. Sautee onions until they start to turn golden on edges. Add Ginger garlic along with meat and fry for few minutes. Add water, enough to cover the meat. If you are using pressure cooker it should take 15-20 minutes. If you are cooking a pot it can take up to 40 minutes.

                Add yoghurt and cook until oil starts to separate. Blitz tomatoes in blender or food processor and add them to the curry. Cook on high flame for few minutes, when the excess water is evaporated cover and cook on low heat. Once tomatoes have broken down and curry is simmering sprinkle garam masala and add whole chillies. Cover for 10 minutes to help curry absorb flavours from chillies.
